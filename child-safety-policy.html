      <h1>Okapi-Z Child Safety Policy</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 2025</p>
      <p>
        At Okapi-Z, we are deeply committed to providing a safe and trusted
        space for all users, especially minors. While our platform is not
        primarily designed for children, we recognize that some users may fall
        within vulnerable age groups, and we take proactive measures to prevent
        any form of child exploitation, abuse, or harm.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Zero Tolerance for Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)</h2>
      <p>
        We have a zero-tolerance policy for any behavior, content, or activity
        that involves child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or facilitates CSAE.
        This includes but is not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sharing or uploading explicit or suggestive images/videos of minors
        </li>
        <li>
          Grooming, solicitation, or any communication with minors intended for
          sexual exploitation
        </li>
        <li>Organizing or promoting events involving child exploitation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Any violation of this policy will result in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Immediate account suspension or ban</li>
        <li>
          Reporting to relevant local and international law enforcement
          authorities
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. In-App Reporting Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        Users can report suspicious, inappropriate, or abusive behavior directly
        through the Okapi-Z app via:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The "Report" button on any user profile, adventure listing, or chat
        </li>
        <li>Our dedicated support email: glodymatayi5@gmail.com</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All reports are taken seriously, prioritized, and reviewed by our
        trained moderation team, who are equipped to escalate issues to the
        appropriate authorities.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Monitoring and Moderation</h2>
      <p>
        We maintain a manual moderation process supported by user reports and
        host verification procedures. We are currently working toward
        integrating automated moderation tools such as keyword filters and
        behavioral monitoring.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Compliance with Laws and Cooperation with Authorities</h2>
      <p>We fully comply with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Korean child protection laws</li>
        <li>
          Global child safety regulations, including COPPA, GDPR (as
          applicable), and guidelines from INTERPOL and local cybercrime units
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Okapi-Z works closely with law enforcement agencies when necessary to
        support investigations and share relevant evidence, while protecting
        user privacy under the law.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Age Restrictions and User Consent</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Users must be at least 18 years old to create an Okapi-Z account or
          host adventures.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 18.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we learn that a user under 18 has registered without guardian
          consent, their account will be deactivated, and any personal data will
          be erased promptly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data Privacy and Protection for Minors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We follow strict data minimization principles, avoiding unnecessary
          collection of personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not allow any user to publish a minor's personal or contact
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our backend systems are protected by industry-standard encryption and
          access controls to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Staff Training and Safety Awareness</h2>

        <li>
          Updates on new threats, grooming patterns, and digital safety trends

      <p>
        We also provide guidance to adventure hosts on how to maintain a safe
        physical environment during offline meetups.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Community Guidelines & Enforcement</h2>

          Strict consequences for harassment, predatory behavior, or nudity
          involving minors
        </li>
